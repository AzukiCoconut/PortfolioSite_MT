A site to showcase the work of Matthew Tingley

## Description
The purpose was to create a site to showcase the work of Matthew Tingley to potential employers. I wanted
to build this website because I felt it was time to create a website that showcased the work I have done, and also
I wanted to attempt to build a website that used only Flexbox as an organizational tool and to build a site with a mobile-first
approach.  I feel I met all those objectives.  

The inspiration for this site came from two websites:
  * The header and navigation for the site came from the Studio Bagaz' site https://www.studiobgz.com/
  * The About Me, Work and Contact Us sections came from a sample site given to me (site unknown).

The site incorporates a few elements that I found interesting from Studio Bagaz' site
  1. The header has a background that is transparent and is fixed to the top of the page.
  2. The navigation bar is fixed to the right side of the screen. The original Studio Bagaz' site implemented
     the navigation bar using CSS Grid, I opted to implement the navigation using CSS Flexbox.  

The transparent header was easy to implement on my own, however the navigation was going to present
a challenge and after much research found the general basis of how to implement it.  See the credit section for the
references for the code I used.  

The remaining elements were fairly easy to implement with some help from reference material.  

I learned quite a bit from this implementation.  
  *  I learned how to implement a website using a mobile-first approach.
  *  I reinforced my understanding of Flexbox
  *  I learned how to implement Media Queries for the different sizing and the nuances of responsive design.
  *  I learned how to implement an overlay as a hover affect incorporating unique icons.
